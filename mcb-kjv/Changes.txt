   Version 1.04 (2014-07-27)
     * Several files: Minor revisions, typo fixes.

   Version 1.03 (2013-08-09)
     * Regenerated the KJV .txt files from the current KJV files available
       at Biola. (There is little difference in content from the previous
       versions. Words previously marked with [...] are no longer so
       marked, and there are other minor punctuation differences.)
     * kjv.sql: Modified CREATE TABLE to update TYPE = MyISAM (obsolete)
       to ENGINE = MyISAM. Added comments about how to use InnoDB instead,
       for MySQL servers that support FULLTEXT for InnoDB (that is, MySQL
       5.6 or higher).
     * index_kjv.sql: Removed this file. Instead, moved index creation
       into kjv.sql.
     * Several files: Minor reformatting.
     * Converted Changes.txt to Changes.xml so that HTML and text versions
       can be generated from the same source. Changes.xml and related
       files are located in the Support directory.

   Version 1.02 (2002-11-01)
     * Add phrase searching and record-count-only options to kjv.pl.

   Version 1.01 (2002-10-24)
     * Added missing mention of escapeHTML in "use CGI" statement in
       kjv.pl.

   Version 1.00 (2002-09-10)
     * Initial release.
